# OPRAST (Osprey Predictive Rocket Analysis & Simulation Tool)


## ðŸ“„ About
This project is a small, model rocket simulation software developed for the CEN4010 Software Engineering class. This program allows a user to build a small model rocket, with real world model rocket parts, and simulate the flight of that rocket. When the flight is done, an analysis page appears with charts including position, velocity, and acceleration graphs, and pertinent info such as max height and air time. The program itself accounts for real world forces a model rocket would experience, such as drag and gravity.

When the program is first launched, the user is met with a menu that allows them to customize the rocket as well as adjust the angle of launch. For each part, there are 3 selections that correlate to real world model rocket parts, with different masses or different thrust curves. When the user selects the launch pad, the flight of the rocket is simulated behind the scenes while the program loads the launch pad.

At the launch pad, the user can launch their rocket and see it fly through the environment. As the rocket is flying, the user can see valuable information including: current height, distance from pad, total velocity, and total acceleration. The user can also go back to the assembly screen and rebuild their rocket or immediately jump to the post flight stats screen.
